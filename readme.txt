Part of assignment (Elements of AI, Dr.Crandall)

Problem statement:


Kam and Lars are planning their upcoming wedding. They’d like to make their banquet as awkward as
possible by ensuring that at each dinner table, no one knows anyone else at the table. Write a program
that computes an assignment of people to tables using as few tables as possible. Your program should

run on the command line:
python wedding.py [friends-file] [seats-per-table]


where friends-file is a text file containing a friendship graph with one line per person, where each
line first lists that person’s name and then the list of people that they know (and we assume that
friendships are bidirectional, i.e. if A is friends with B then B is automatically friends with A), and
seats-per-table is an integer saying the maximum number of people that can be seated at a table.
The program can output whatever you’d like, except that the last line of output should be a machinereadable
representation of the solution you found, in this format:
[table-count] [table1-person1],[table1-person2],... [table2-person1],[table2-person2],...


For example,

python wedding.py myfriends.txt 3

with input file:

davis steven sal joe jinnie zeming emma jayceon
jayceon jinnie zeming
jinne zeming
emma steven jinnie
steven sal joe


might give the result:

4 davis emma,jayceon jinnie,joe,sal steven,zeming
